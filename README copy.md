General info
Travel God aims to make the act of seeing whats happening at a given area easier. It centralizes various needs of a trip. In one search, the user can see a map of the area, a 7 day weather forecast, important locations nearby, and events. Once the user searches a city, it is saved to local stoarge and is then displayed as a new button. The button can be clicked to show all the information of that city once again.
